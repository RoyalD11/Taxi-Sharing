look into cost google has a thing to calculate point to point for a taxi
	add a field to check if the discount is worth the sharing ride element
	peak times vs regular, solo vs sharing

the driver has to accept all rides, the passengers can choose to decline, or vice versa, choose one

add a driver field to say how much lugage you can carry
focus on back end flow, passing of information between the two apps
matching itself isnt a priority, get the information passing between

meeting point post 5 airport

decline ride, add an option to re-match if they want to decline, and then add an option to specify
	if they want to keep the driver and not match with passenger
	if they want a new driver 
	if they want a new everything


User information can be saved to the phone, dont have to worry about phone payment, 
	driver can be paid in cash, or they could have a wireless debit in the car for payment
	dont worry about app taking a cut

goal to have a seperate server that can comunicate through driver app and multiple passengers
	GET MULTIPLE PASSENGERS WORKING, HOW DO I DO THIS



Report - Refer to the thesis example Doron sent
	start right now

	write motivation, background, program working in, what weve done
	backgound other apps, background what we are using, tech using
	what we did what we worked on, issues, overcoming troubles
	actual app, what was implemented,
	conclusions
	bibliography, every source used and refereced, both research and code help


	I should have an interaction diagram, to show sending of information 
	comment the code!!!!!!!

	This is joint, reference Moh in the project can even use screen shots from him
	we may have incredibly similar parts
