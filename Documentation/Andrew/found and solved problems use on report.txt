problems ran into across dev

app crash on new android devices
	needed to add <uses-library android:name="org.apache.http.legacy" android:required="false" /> to manifest
	this was a bug in google play services on googles end, this was the temp fix that they turned into the real fix

app refused to sign in or create account
	Firebase required 6 character passwords, but would not prompt that
	log file revelaed error

google maps api would not work, crash on load
	'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:16.0.0' was the wrong version
	once version updated it worked perfectly

request permissions for location was crashing application
	method i was asking for permissions was crashing application
	it was a logic error, permission check was after map load so prompt to ask for permission would
	never trigger causing a crash when permission was not available.

Log out bug, crashes when signing out as it attempts to get the current user id for some reason even though its left the page
