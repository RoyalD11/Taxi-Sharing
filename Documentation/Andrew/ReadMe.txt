ReadMe - Honours Project

To open the android studio project:
-----------------------------------
First you need to have android studio downloaded and installed
when you load the application you want to open an existing project
navigate to the directory you stored the folder in
there should be an andoird studio file you can open titled "My Second App"
plug in an android device to the computer and click run (the green triangle) in the upper right
android studio should detect your device and you simply double click that device
The program will then compile and open on your device as an application

You can play around with the application once it is open on your phone, all the
buttons work and all the input fields work as well.

to open the bmpr file
---------------------
you need to download the program balsamiq
it is the file that is produced from this program
once loaded into the file you can either navigate through the markups ive made (similar to a ppt)
or click play in the top right and thr drawings will come together to replicate an application
all the buttons will work and you can click through them to see how the app is designed

I have also included a zip file that is all the drawings of the prototypes i made
if you cant open the balsamiq file
